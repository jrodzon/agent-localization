In the past several years, there have been many possible uses for RGB-D-based technologies.
However, most of them focus on detailed scanning like Honti et al. \cite{articleRecentRGBD}
with little use for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM).
Resuming, the more progress in neural networks,
the more the scientific community moves away from RGB-D in favor of plain RGB.
